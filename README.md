# PhishDetect

## INTRODUCTION

The Internet global connectivity is regarded as a crossroads where users can meet and share information. This is the primary reason phishers choose this method of data exchange as a point of contact to conduct widespread phishing attacks by infecting computers with spyware that directs people to bogus websites. <br>
  Phishing attack is one of the most dangerous threats to online accounts and data because these attacks pose as a trustworthy firm or person, and they employ social engineering techniques to make victims more likely to fall for the scam.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Developing effective methods to identify and prevent fraudulent websites aimed at deceiving users and stealing sensitive information.

## AIM

The aim of this project is to detect phishing websites using machine learning by developing a web application that allows users to check if a URL is phishing or legitimate and have access to resources to help tackle phishing attacks.

## OBJECTIVES

The objective of this project is to train machine learning models on the dataset created to predict phishing websites. Both phishing and legitimate URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them required URL and website content-based features are extracted. The performance level of each model is measured and compared.

## STAGES

i. Dataset collection and pre-processing; <br>
ii. Machine learning model selection and development ; <br>
iii. Development of a web-based application for detection; <br>
iv. Integration of the developed model to web application;

## SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT

Due to the fraudulent websites built on the World Wide Web in the previous decade to mimic reputable websites and steal financial assets from users and organizations. Hence phishing attack has become so prevalent such that it has cost the internet community and other stakeholders hundreds of millions of dollars. Thus, robust countermeasures that can identify phishing are required. 

These are the challenges to be addressed in this project:
I. Reduce the rate of financial theft from individuals and organizations online. <br>
II. Educate Internet Users on the deception technique of phishers. <br>
III. Educate Internet users on the countermeasures of phishing attack.

## CONCLUSION

The contribution of this research work is to help both individuals and organization identify and understand phishing techniques used by phisher as well as help them detect phishing URL attack effectively and efficiently by employing machine learning models instead of the previous method of detecting phishing website.

## FUTURE SCOPE 

Through this project, one can know a lot about phishing attacks and how to prevent them. This project can be taken further by creating a browser extension that can be installed on any web browser to detect phishing URL Links.
